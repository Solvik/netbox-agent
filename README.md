# Netbox agent


This project aims to create hardware automatically into [Netbox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox) based on standard tools (dmidecode, lldpd, parsing /sys/, etc).

The goal is to generate an existing infrastructure on Netbox and have the ability to update it regularly by executing the agent.

# Features

* Create servers, chassis and blade through standard tools (`dmidecode`)
* Create physical, bonding and vlan network interfaces with IPs
* Create IPMI interface if found
* Create or get existing VLAN and associate it to interfaces
* Generic ability to guess datacenters and rack location through drivers (`cmd` and `file` and custom ones)
* Update existing `Device` and `Interfaces`
* Handle blade moving (new slot, new chassis)

# Requirements

- Netbox >= 2.6
- Python >= 3.4
- [python3-netaddr](https://github.com/drkjam/netaddr)
- [python3-netifaces](https://github.com/al45tair/netifaces)

- ethtool
- dmidecode
- ipmitool

# Known limitations

* The project is only compatible with Linux.
Since it uses `ethtool` and parses `/sys/` directory, it's not compatible with *BSD distributions.
* Netbox `>=2.6.0,<=2.6.2` has a caching problem ; if the cache lifetime is too high, the script can get stale data after modification.
We advise to set `CACHE_TIME` to `0`.

# Configuration

```
netbox:
 url: 'http://netbox.internal.company.com'
 token: supersecrettoken

network:
  ignore_interfaces: "(dummy.*|docker.*)"
  ignore_ips: (127\.0\.0\..*)

datacenter_location:
 driver: "cmd:cat /etc/qualification | tr [a-z] [A-Z]"
 regex: "DATACENTER: (?P<datacenter>[A-Za-z0-9]+)"
# driver: 'cmd:lldpctl'
# regex: 'SysName: .*\.([A-Za-z0-9]+)'
#
# driver: "file:/tmp/datacenter"
# regex: "(.*)"

rack_location:
# driver: 'cmd:lldpctl'
# match SysName: sw-dist-a1.dc42
# regex: 'SysName:[ ]+[A-Za-z]+-[A-Za-z]+-([A-Za-z0-9]+)'
#
# driver: "file:/tmp/datacenter"
# regex: "(.*)"
```

# Hardware

# TODO

- [ ] Handle switch <> NIC connections (using lldp)
- [ ] CPU, RAID Card(s), RAM, Disks in `Device`'s `Inventory`
- [ ] `CustomFields` support with firmware versions for Device (BIOS), RAID Cards and disks
